# AWS Cloud Club @ SMU

Welcome to the github space for the AWS Cloud Club @ SMU.
Our github space contains all of our code for all of the workshops taught in existance.

We are a community of students passionate about cloud computing and AWS. Our goal is to share our passion with others and teach them the skills needed to be successful in the cloud.

We also believe that learning should be accessible to everyone. That's why we make all of our workshops and materials available for free. We want to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to learn about cloud computing, regardless of their background or financial situation.

So if you're interested in learning about cloud computing and want to be a part of a community that is passionate about it, then join us! We would love to have you as a part of our community.
